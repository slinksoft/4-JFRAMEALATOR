# 4-JFRAMEALATOR
Java GUI  Four Function Calculator
----------------------------------

This a simple GUI program I developed after learning various topics in my Programming 1 class at FIU. Topics include defining/creating 
classes and methods, creating new instance of classes and calling them in from another class, passing variables through methods, 
and more.
